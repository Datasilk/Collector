# Collector
A web scraping platform for the AI era.


### History
I started this project in 2015 by building [Charlotte](https://github.com/Datasilk/Charlotte) along with a web UI in ASP.NET Core using C#. I've built this project from the ground up several times, eventually transforming it into a plugin for [Saber](https://github.com/Datasilk/Saber) (a website builder), and so now I am turning it into a set of tools. 

### Collector.App
The new Collector app will be a .NET command-line-based web server with a web UI for managing all your collections of data. 

### Collector.Common
A common .NET library that contains all the common functionality of the Collector App so that you can build your own app to collect data from the web.

### Collector.YouTube
A .NET command-line tool for scraping YouTube based on what kind of content you are looking for. Uses AI to build search queries for YouTube.
